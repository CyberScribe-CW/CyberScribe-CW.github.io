<main><p>This website is designed to display all my projects and pieces of work, as well as various aspects of myself, who I am, and what I can offer to you.
    <br><br>
    This portfolio is a demonstration of my achievements, talents, experience, and the overall quality of my work. My goal is to show you just what I can do and how well I qualify for your organization. You will see examples of my strong work ethic, my expansive creativity, and my unrelenting determination.

This portfolio not only acts as a resume to show my professional attributes, but also as a display of all my work, feats, and overall creative experience.
