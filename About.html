    <h2>Aspiring Writer</h2>
    
    <p>My name is <strong>Clayton Wilhelm</strong>. 
        I am 21 years old. 
        I am a hard working and creative mind that thrives at creating and writing fictional narratives and characters. 
        I also enjoy and have experience in video editing, animation, photoshop, and other adobe programs. <br><br> I plan on pursuing a career as an author. I graduated from St. Louis Community College with an AA in General Studies. 
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Digital Storytelling, with a focus in animation, at the University of Missouri in Columbia. 
        I am expected to graduate in May of 2025.</p>
