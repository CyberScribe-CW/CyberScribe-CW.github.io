<main class="Reflection">
<div class="first-para">
This past year at Mizzou has to be my most eventful, educational, expressive, but also stressful and work-heavy year of my academic life. These courses have taught me so much, both in terms of education and outside of school. I’ve learned time management and how to live on my own and depend on only myself. I’ve also learned valuable skills in areas like animation, audio editing, script writing, and video editing, skills that have evolved my career goals for the better. I feel I have grown, both as a person and as a creator, thanks to these programs, even if many of their lessons were pretty harsh at times.
</div>
<br>
<div class="indent">
Pursuing a degree in digital storytelling hasn’t had nearly as much writing as I would have hoped, but the courses I have taken have taught me so much more than I could have hoped for in other fields. These new skills not only have broadened my career paths, but also given me insight on the various aspects of media production, knowledge that is valuable when creating my own media. I feel more empowered than ever when it comes to creating my stories, because now I have the knowledge and tools necessary to take them beyond just ideas and words on a page.
</div>
<br>
<div class="indent">
This whole journey, of course, has had a lot of issues. These past courses have pushed me to my limits, placed a lot of stress on me, and overall had a lot of mental health issues. I had to learn the hard way how to manage my time, how to work under pressure to meet deadlines, and most importantly learn how important it is to give some priority to mental health. I’m still trying to kick my bad habit of overworking myself, giving myself time to destress and recharge, and not letting my work consume me, but I’m getting better at it.
</div>
<br>
<div class="indent">
I only hope that this final year at Mizzou will work out well in the end. I plan on making sure I learn from the past to make my future bright, and to take every day one step at a time.
